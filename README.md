# Cloud Pak for Data installer for IBM Cloud

This repository houses a set of automation for deploying infrastructure, openshift, and cloud pak for data.

## Prerequisites

- Ansible
- terraform > 0.12
- [ibmcloud provider](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm)

Note: you can install the provider by running the included `provider.sh` script. It will install v1.2.5, but this can be changed by editing the appropriate variable within the script.
  
## Files required

in a folder in the root of this repository called `installer_files` place 2 files for cloud pak install:

- cloudpak4data-ee-v2.5.0.0.tgz
- repo.yaml

These can be acquired by running the CP4D bin file.

## Variables

There are a few variables that must be set for the install to take place successfully.

- [ibmcloud_api_key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userapikey)
- iaas_classic_username (this is your login for IBM cloud)
- [iaas_classic_api_key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-classic_keys)
- redhat_un
- redhat_pw
- [openshift_pool_id](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/253273) (the rhsm pool with the appropriate licenses)
- domain (a domain that already exists in IBM Cloud)
  
Additionally it is recommended to set additional variables:

- ssh-key (a list of strings with the ID of an ssh key already in IBM Cloud)
- cluster_name (a random string, used for your cluster URL)
- region
- datacenter
- tags (a list of strings of tags to apply to the infrastructure)

## Deployment

To run this deployment run this series of commands from the root folder

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan #check your plan is as expected
terraform apply
ansible-playbook main.yaml
```

due to some complications with the deployment of ocp the last command must be run from the installer node provisioned during the deployment.
This command will also be printed at the end of the previous playbook

```bash
ssh root@<installer_ip> -i <project_dir>/installer_files/id_rsa
ansible-playbook /opt/installer/main.yaml
```

## Post Install

Your cluster will be up and available at a url with this format
`https://console.apps.<cluster_name>.<domain>`

The default credentials are:

```
username: ocpadmin
password: Ch4ngeM3
```
